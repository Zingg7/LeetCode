# 122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II(easy)

## Description
> 原题连接: https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/

```
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy
one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

Note: 
You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before buy again).

Example 1:
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
             
Example 2:
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
             
Example 3:
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

按数组排列顺序,输出升序排列首尾差值的和

## Solution

emmm这个题目有点太简单了? 就是当下一个数比上一个数大时,将它们的差值加入最后的总和即可...                                    
那么为什么这样呢, Example 2其实已经给了我们提示,如果呈升序排列,最大可获得的差值就是每个数之间的差值相加了.                    
假设今天获得,明天抛出,若第三天价格更高,则直接第三天抛出会更赚,因为抛出的那天是不能继续获得利润的.                     
这样我们就可以获得最后的答案了.


## Code

```java
class Solution122 {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int max = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++){
            max += Math.max(0, prices[i] - prices[i-1]);
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```
