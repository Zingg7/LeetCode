# 1038. Binary Search Tree to Greater Sum Tree

## Description

> Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search-tree-to-greater-sum-tree/submissions/

```
Given the root of a binary search tree with distinct values, modify it so that every node has a new value equal
to the sum of the values of the original tree that are greater than or equal to node.val.

As a reminder, a binary search tree is a tree that satisfies these constraints:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
 
Example 1:
Input: [4,1,6,0,2,5,7,null,null,null,3,null,null,null,8]
Output: [30,36,21,36,35,26,15,null,null,null,33,null,null,null,8]
 
Note:
The number of nodes in the tree is between 1 and 100.
Each node will have value between 0 and 100.
The given tree is a binary search tree.

> Related Topics: Tree

由于是二叉搜索树，因此需要先搜右，创造一个变量sum存储不断增长的sum，直到搜索至最小子节点后，将该子节点的值记为当前节点的值+sum。深度遍历直至搜索完整个树。


## Code

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    int pre = 0;
    public TreeNode bstToGst(TreeNode root) {
        if (root.right != null) bstToGst(root.right); 
        pre = pre + root.val;
        root.val = pre;
        if (root.left != null) bstToGst(root.left); 
        return root;
    }
}
```
