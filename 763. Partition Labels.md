# 763. Partition Labels

## Description

> Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-labels/

```
A string S of lowercase letters is given. We want to partition this string into as many parts as possible so 
that each letter appears in at most one part, and return a list of integers representing the size of these
parts.

Example 1:
Input: S = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
Output: [9,7,8]
Explanation:
The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits S into less parts.

Note:
S will have length in range [1, 500].
S will consist of lowercase letters ('a' to 'z') only.

利用一个HashMap存储每个字符最后一次出现的位置，再遍历这个字符串，如果在最后一次出现前中间的字母的最后出现位置超过原位置，则扩张，否则不变。当当前检查位置与保存的最远位置相同时，该串即结束了。


## Code

```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> partitionLabels(String S) {
        int[] map = new int[26];
        List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < S.length(); i++) {
            map[S.charAt(i)-'a'] = i;
        }
        
        int curr = 0, length = 0;;
        for (int i = 0; i < S.length(); i++) {
            curr = Math.max(curr, map[S.charAt(i)-'a']);
            length ++;
            if (curr == i) {
                res.add(length);
                length = 0;
            }
        }
        
        return res;
    }
}
```
