# 36. Valid Sudoku

## Description

> Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-sudoku/

```
Determine if a 9x9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the 
following rules:
Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each of the 9 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.

A partially filled sudoku which is valid.
The Sudoku board could be partially filled, where empty cells are filled with the character '.'.

Example 1:
Input:
[
  ["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
  ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
  [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
  ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
  ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
  ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
  [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
  [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
  [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]
]
Output: true

Example 2:
Input:
[
  ["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
  ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
  [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
  ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
  ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
  ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
  [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
  [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
  [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]
]
Output: false
Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being modified to 8. Since there 
are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.
    
Note:
A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.
The given board contain only digits 1-9 and the character '.'.
The given board size is always 9x9.

判断矩阵是否为有效数独矩阵

## Solution

这题有点意思，方法也很巧妙~<br>
数独矩阵的规则是同一列、同一行以及各个3*3小矩阵中无重复数字，看到重复数字就很容易想到HashSet了，
这里直接利用行、列、小矩阵的数学特点命名set中的元素，当元素非'.'且加入失败则表示它重复了。


## Code

```java
class Solution36 {
    public boolean isValidSudoku(char[][] board) {
        Set set = new HashSet();
        for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 9; j++) {
                char n = board[i][j];
                if (n != '.'){
                    if (!set.add(i+"row: "+n) || 
                        !set.add(j+"col: "+n) ||
                        !set.add(i/3+"row,"+j/3+"col: "+n)) return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
