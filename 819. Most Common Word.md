# 819. Most Common Word (easy)

## Description

> Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/most-common-word/

```
Given a paragraph and a list of banned words, return the most frequent word that is not in the list 
of banned words.  It is guaranteed there is at least one word that isn't banned, and that the answer
is unique.

Words in the list of banned words are given in lowercase, and free of punctuation.  Words in the 
paragraph are not case sensitive.  The answer is in lowercase.

Example:
Input: 
paragraph = "Bob hit a ball, the hit BALL flew far after it was hit."
banned = ["hit"]
Output: "ball"
Explanation: 
"hit" occurs 3 times, but it is a banned word.
"ball" occurs twice (and no other word does), so it is the most frequent non-banned word in the 
paragraph. 
Note that words in the paragraph are not case sensitive,
that punctuation is ignored (even if adjacent to words, such as "ball,"), 
and that "hit" isn't the answer even though it occurs more because it is banned.
 

Note:
1 <= paragraph.length <= 1000.
0 <= banned.length <= 100.
1 <= banned[i].length <= 10.
The answer is unique, and written in lowercase (even if its occurrences in paragraph may have 
uppercase symbols, and even if it is a proper noun.)
paragraph only consists of letters, spaces, or the punctuation symbols !?',;.
There are no hyphens or hyphenated words.
Words only consist of letters, never apostrophes or other punctuation symbols.

## Solution

> Related Topics: String

这里由于字母之间并不严格按照空格进行区分，因此不能使用split方法。

在这里可以采用isLetter()方法检查当前的字符是否为字母，如果是字母，那么将其变为小写，储存到StringBuilder中。如果非字母，那么当前字符串记录完毕，将其存储在HashMap中，对应的Value值为原来的值1。注意此时要检查一下当前记录的字符串长度是否为0，为0则代表有连续的非字母元素。储存完成后查看其是否大于当前记录的最大值，若是则更新最大值并记录当前值。同时注意完成后要新建StringBuilder。


### 易错点
> 遇到到非字母元素时需要检查当前记录的字符串长度是否为0

> 字符串结束后要新建StringBuilder


## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public String mostCommonWord(String paragraph, String[] banned) {
        paragraph += ".";
        Set<String> banSet = new HashSet<>();
        for (String str : banned) banSet.add(str);
        
        int max = 0;
        String res = "";
        StringBuilder word = new StringBuilder();
        Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (char c : paragraph.toCharArray()) {
            if (Character.isLetter(c)) {
                word.append(Character.toLowerCase(c)); //
            } else if (word.length() > 0) {
                String wordNow = word.toString();
                if (!banSet.contains(wordNow)) {
                    map.put(wordNow, map.getOrDefault(wordNow, 0) + 1);
                    if (map.get(wordNow) > max) {
                        max = map.get(wordNow);
                        res = wordNow;
                    }
                }
                word = new StringBuilder();
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
