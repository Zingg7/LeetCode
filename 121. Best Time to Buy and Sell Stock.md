# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock(easy)

## Description
> 原题连接: https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/

```
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock),
design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

Example 1:
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
             
Example 2:
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

按数组排列顺序,寻找最大差距

## Solution
> 使用方法: Dynamic Programming, Kadane's Algorithm

在[LC53. Maximum Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/)基础上延伸

创造一个变量maxSofar,存储整个检验过程中最大的差; 创造一个变量maxNow,存储当前检验循环中的最大值                      
遍历数组,检查下一个数是否比当前数大                                                                                
若大于当前数,表明最大差距还在增大,相应更新当前循环检验最大值;                                                
若小于该数,则表明最大差距不再增大,那么当前循环检验结束,将当前循环检验最大值赋0                                             
每次检验时都比较maxSofar与maxNow的大小,将较大的值赋给maxSofar



## Code

```java
class Solution121 {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int maxSofar = 0, maxNow = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++){
            maxNow = Math.max(0, prices[i] - prices[i-1] + maxNow);
            maxSofar = Math.max(maxSofar, maxNow);
        }
        return maxSofar;
    }
}
```
