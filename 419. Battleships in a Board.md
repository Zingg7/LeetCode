# 419. Battleships in a Board

## Description

> Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/battleships-in-a-board/

```
Given an 2D board, count how many battleships are in it. The battleships are represented with 'X's, empty slots
are represented with '.'s. You may assume the following rules:
You receive a valid board, made of only battleships or empty slots.
Battleships can only be placed horizontally or vertically. In other words, they can only be made of the shape
1xN (1 row, N columns) or Nx1 (N rows, 1 column), where N can be of any size.
At least one horizontal or vertical cell separates between two battleships - there are no adjacent battleships.

Example:
X..X
...X
...X
In the above board there are 2 battleships.

Invalid Example:
...X
XXXX
...X
This is an invalid board that you will not receive - as battleships will always have a cell separating between 
them.

Follow up:
Could you do it in one-pass, using only O(1) extra memory and without modifying the value of the board?

甲板上有多少战舰

```


## Solution

这题的意思是，一艘战舰在甲板上可横放或竖放，宽度为1，两艘战舰之间必有空格，求甲板上有多少战舰。

看了下解答，这个真的很棒棒惹！每次检查的时候看看当前格子是否有战舰，若有则检查其上或左是否也有战舰的躯体，如果有，代表这个格子已经被计算过了，直接continue就可以了~ 否则就将计数值+1。啦啦啦就这样咯！


## Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int countBattleships(char[][] board) {
        if (board == null || board.length == 0) return 0;
        int count = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < board.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < board[0].length; j++) {
                if (board[i][j] == '.') continue;
                if (i > 0 && board[i-1][j] == 'X') continue;
                if (j > 0 && board[i][j-1] == 'X') continue;
                count ++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
