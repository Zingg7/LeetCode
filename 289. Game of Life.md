# 289. Game of Life

## Description

> Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/game-of-life/

```
According to the Wikipedia's article: "The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton 
devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."

Given a board with m by n cells, each cell has an initial state live (1) or dead (0). Each cell interacts with 
its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above 
Wikipedia article):
Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population..
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

Write a function to compute the next state (after one update) of the board given its current state. The next 
state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births 
and deaths occur simultaneously.

Example:
Input: 
[
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,1],
  [1,1,1],
  [0,0,0]
]
Output: 
[
  [0,0,0],
  [1,0,1],
  [0,1,1],
  [0,1,0]
]

Follow up:
Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated at the same time: You cannot update
some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.
In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would 
cause problems when the active area encroaches the border of the array. How would you address these problems?

废话很多，核心是这几句：<br>
如果1周围八个位置的1少于两个，则该位置1变0；<br>
如果1周围八个位置有两个或三个1，则该位置1不变；<br>
如果1周围八个位置有超过三个1，则该位置1变0；<br>
如果0周围正好有三个1，则该位置0变1；<br>

再简化一下，若1周围有2个以下或3个以上1，则变0；若0周围有3个1，则变1。<br>
所以活的情况就是：九宫格内包含自己一共有3个1或一共有4个1且自身为1。<br>

对每个cell，遍历其周围的8个格子，计算其周围1的个数。若满足上述条件，就将其下一个状态置为1，否则为0。<br>
遍历完成后，将当前状态转化为下一状态（使用位运算）。

board[i][j] |= 0b10;


## Code

```java
class Solution {
    public void gameOfLife(int[][] board) {
        if (board == null || board.length == 0) return;
        
        int m = board.length, n = board[0].length;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
                int lives = 0;
                for (int y = Math.max(0, i-1); y < Math.min(m, i+2); y++) {
                    for (int x = Math.max(0, j-1); x < Math.min(n, j+2); x++) {
                        lives += board[y][x] & 1;
                    }
                }
                if (lives == 3 || (lives == 4 && board[i][j] == 1)) 
                    board[i][j] |= 0b10;
            }
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                board[i][j] >>= 1;
            }
        }
            
    }
