# 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array (easy)

## Description

> Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/

```
Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appear only once and return the
new length.
Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) 
extra memory.

Example 1:
Given nums = [1,1,2],
Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.

Example 2:
Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4],
Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being modified to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 
respectively.
It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.

Clarification:
Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?
Note that the input array is passed in by reference, which means modification to the input array will be known 
to the caller as well.

Internally you can think of this:
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);
// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}

去除数组中重复的元素并返回新长度

要求不用extra space，那么就在原数组上生成去除后新数组。<br>
用一个变量存储目前的不重复值，如果遍历到的数的值与它相同，则表明重复了，不做操作；
如果与它不同，那么则是非重复值，将此数赋值到nums[不重复值]中，并将当前不重复值+1。


## Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length <= 1) return nums.length;
        
        int now = nums[0], count = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] != now) {
                now = nums[i];
                nums[count] = nums[i];
                count ++;
            }            
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
