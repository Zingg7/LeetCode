# 123. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III (hard)

## Description

> Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iii/

```
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you
buy again).

Example 1:
Input: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
             Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.

Example 2:
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.

Example 3:
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

维护一个二维DP数组，其中一维表示可销售多少次，另一维表示第N天最大收益。

状态转移方程式为 `proit = Math.max(profit, prices[j] - prices[m] + dp[i-1][m])`<BR>
表示 `原收入` 与 `在第m天买入第j天卖出赚的钱 + 之前所赚的钱`


## Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices, int K) {
        if (prices == null || prices.length ==0) return 0;
        // int K = 2;
        int[][] dp = new int[K+1][prices.length];
        for (int i = 1; i <= K; i++) {
            int minCost = prices[0];
            for (int j = 1; j < prices.length; j++) {
                int currCost = prices[j-1] - dp[i-1][j-1]; // if buy at `j-1`
                if (currCost < minCost) minCost = currCost;
                int profit = prices[j] - minCost;
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(profit, dp[i][j-1]);
            }
        }
        return dp[K][prices.length-1];
    }
}
