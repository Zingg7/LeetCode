# 100. Same Tree (easy)

## Description

> Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree/

```
Given two binary trees, write a function to check if they are the same or not.
Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical and the nodes have the same value.

Example 1:
Input:     1         1
          / \       / \
         2   3     2   3

        [1,2,3],   [1,2,3]

Output: true

Example 2:
Input:     1         1
          /           \
         2             2

        [1,2],     [1,null,2]

Output: false

是否为同一个树
