# 133. Clone Graph

## Description

> Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/

```
Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph, return a deep copy (clone) of the graph. Each node
in the graph contains a val (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.

Example:
Input:
{"$id":"1","neighbors":[{"$id":"2","neighbors":[{"$ref":"1"},{"$id":"3","neighbors":[{"$ref":"2"},{"$id":"4",
"neighbors":[{"$ref":"3"},{"$ref":"1"}],"val":4}],"val":3}],"val":2},{"$ref":"4"}],"val":1}
Explanation:
Node 1's value is 1, and it has two neighbors: Node 2 and 4.
Node 2's value is 2, and it has two neighbors: Node 1 and 3.
Node 3's value is 3, and it has two neighbors: Node 2 and 4.
Node 4's value is 4, and it has two neighbors: Node 1 and 3.
 
Note:
The number of nodes will be between 1 and 100.
The undirected graph is a simple graph, which means no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
Since the graph is undirected, if node p has node q as neighbor, then node q must have node p as neighbor too.
You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.

```


## Solution

> Related Topics: DFS, BFS, Graph

创建一个Queue，用来存储当前需要遍历的节点 `Queue<Node> queue`<Br>
创建一个HashMap，用来存储生成的克隆节点 `HashMap<节点的值，节点> cloneNode`<Br>
HashMap用节点的值来作为key-节点的指示（这里默认无重复），value指示节点，包含节点的邻居<Br>

将头节点放入Queue以及HashMap中，每次取出Queue中的节点，检查其所有邻居<Br>
若在Map中不存在（即未被克隆过），那么创造一个复制的节点，并将其放入cloneNode与queue中；将该节点放入元节点的邻居中<Br>

## 易错点

> 将当前遍历的邻居节点放入元节点的邻居中

`neighbors.add(cloneNode.get(neighbor.val))`



## Code

```java
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;

    public Node() {}

    public Node(int _val,List<Node> _neighbors) {
        val = _val;
        neighbors = _neighbors;
    }
};
*/
class Solution {
    public Node cloneGraph(Node node) {
        if (node == null) return null;
        // create a queue: go through all the node
        Queue<Node> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        // create a hashmap: store the clone node and its neighbor
        Map<Integer, Node> cloneNode = new HashMap<>();
        
        // Initialization
        queue.offer(node);
        cloneNode.put(node.val, new Node(node.val, new ArrayList<>()));

        // go through the queue
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            Node n = queue.poll();
            for (Node neighbor: n.neighbors) {
                if (!cloneNode.containsKey(neighbor.val)) {
                    Node newNode = new Node(neighbor.val, new ArrayList<>());
                    cloneNode.put(neighbor.val, newNode);
                    queue.offer(neighbor);
                }
                cloneNode.get(n.val).neighbors.add(cloneNode.get(neighbor.val));
            }
        }
        return cloneNode.get(node.val);
    }
}
```
使用递归，更快
```java
class Solution {
    Map<Node, Node> hm = new HashMap<>();
    public Node cloneGraph(Node node) {
        if(node == null) return null;
        if(hm.containsKey(node)) return hm.get(node);
        hm.put(node, new Node(node.val, new ArrayList<>()));
        for(Node nei: node.neighbors){
            hm.get(node).neighbors.add(cloneGraph(nei));
        }
        return hm.get(node);
    }
}
```
